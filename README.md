*"If you really believe, something is impossible: Prove it! Show the world, just how impossible it is, by giving it all to make it reality! Maybe along the way, you find out you were wrong, and do the impossible. And if you find out, you were right, so what? Even if you jump for the stars and miss, you still gonna land on the moon." - Gamerchamp3000, "VG Myths - Super Mario Odyssey's Impossible Jumpless Moons"*
